        Even though computers were not  built until the mid 1900s, the first idea for a computer was in fact developed by Charles Babbage. In the early 1830s, the <em> Difference Engine </em> was partially completed and his second and more complex design, The <em> Analytical Engine </em>,  was never completed at all. Despite this fact both engines could be very powerful, especially in that time period. Even though his plans did not come through, he is distinguished as a man ahead of his times because he stands as an inspiration to computer visionaries today.

        Babbage's <q cite="">second <em> Difference Engine </em></q> was finally manufactured not until almost 160 years later. The first working version of this machine was built by the Science Museum in London, for the Babbage bicentenary in 1991. It can now be seen at the Museum; a second machine was then built for an American high-tech millionnaire, who put it in the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California. Babbage's <em> Analytical Engines </em> would have used "programmes" like those used in the textile industry to make complicated patterns; but they were never built.

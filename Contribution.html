       <em> The <em> Difference Engine </em> </em> could compute calculations such as addition or multiplication, but its most important ability was to create tables of the results for up to seven-degree polynomial functions. The funds to complete the project were dropped even though it was close to being finished in <strong> 1832 </strong> and this was the end of his project.

       In <strong> 1837 </strong>, Babbage had come up with an idea of a computer that could understand commands and could be programmed in the same way as a modern-day computer. The idea was called the <em> Analytical Engine</em>.<br>
       The <em> Analytical Engine </em> was the first machine ever designed with the idea of programming. He started working on the <em> Analytical Engine </em> when his work on the <em> Difference Engine </em> was stopped and continued on this for most of his life.

        Unfortunately Babbageâ€™s <em> Analytical Engine </em> was never completed due to mostly political and economic concerns. <br> His ideas were isolated at the time, and no other attempts at building such a computer were thought of again until the next century. Babbage is known as the <em> <strong> <q cite="">Father of Computers</q> </strong> </em>, due to his early, but isolated contributions to the field.

        Charles Babbage was born on December 26, 1791 in London, England. He is known to be a mathematician, philosopher and inventor.
        Moreover he is often called <strong><q cite="">The Father of Computing</q></strong> and he detailed plans for <em>Analytical Engines,
        Mechanical Calculating Engines</em> and <em> Difference Engine </em>s. Charles died on the 18<sup>th</sup> of October 1871 in London.

      <p2>
        In the <strong>1820</strong>s Babbage worked on his <q cite=""><em>Difference Engine</em></q>, which is a machine that could perform mathematical calculations. Initially, a six-wheeled model was constructed and demonstrated to various audiences.
        <br>
        Later on he developed plans for a beter and bigger machine; the <q cite=""><em>Difference Engine 2</em></q>. Additionally he worked on another invention, a revolutionary device that his fame as a computer pioneer now largely rests, the more complex Analytical Engine. The device was intended to be able to perform any arithmetical calculation using punched cards that would deliver the instructions, as well as a memory unit to store numbers and many other fundamental components of today's computers.
      </p2>

      <br><br>

      <p3>
        A British mathematician named Ada Lovelace has completed a program for Babbage's Engine but in the end neither the <em> Analytical Engine</em>, nor the <em> Difference Engine 2 </em>, were finished in Babbage's lifetime.
